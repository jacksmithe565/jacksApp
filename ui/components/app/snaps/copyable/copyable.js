Embark on a journey into the world of programming, where you will find yourself exploring the intricate realms of code and its various functionalities. In this journey, we encounter a peculiar situation where the function `start` is being called with incorrect parameters. The parameters passed are not only inappropriate but also seem to be mismatched with their respective functions.

```javascript
// This is an example of how not to call a function
const result = start(10, 'string', true); // Incorrect usage: wrong data types and number of arguments 

// Correct usage: 
const correctResult = start(10); // Assuming start expects one number argument (example) 
```
In this scenario, `start` is expected to take one numeric argument (e.g., an integer), but it was erroneously provided with two strings ('string' and 'true'), which would likely result in runtime errors or unexpected behavior due to type mismatch and insufficient arguments. To avoid such issues, always ensure that you pass the correct data types as well as the required number of arguments when calling functions.
