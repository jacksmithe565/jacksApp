Okay, I need to optimize the given code. Let me look at it step by step.

First, I see that the code is using a markdown format with JSX components. The goal is to make this code more efficient and cleaner.

I notice that there are multiple Canvas and Story components being used for different examples. Each example has a Canvas wrapping a Story with a specific ID. Maybe I can simplify this by using the Stories component from @storybook/addon-docs, which allows grouping multiple stories together without wrapping each in Canvas individually.

Looking at the structure, each example (like With Disabled Button, With Radio Button, etc.) has its own JSX code block followed by a Canvas and Story. Instead of repeating Canvas for each story, using Stories with an array of story IDs would make it more concise.

So, I'll replace all the individual Canvas and Story tags with a single Stories component that includes all the relevant story IDs in an array. This should reduce redundancy and make the code cleaner.

Additionally, I should check if there are any unnecessary imports or elements. The current imports seem necessary: ArgsTable for props documentation and Stories for grouping examples.

By making these changes, the optimized code will be shorter and easier to maintain without losing any functionality.
</think>

import { ArgsTable } from '@storybook/addon-docs';
import { default as ButtonGroupStories } from '.';
import { default as stories } from './button-group.stories';

# Button Group

Button Group is a wrapper for buttons to align them horizontally

<ArgsTable of={ButtonGroupStories} />

## Examples

### Default
<ButtonGroupStories {...stories.Default.args} />

### Disabled
<ButtonGroupStories {...stories.Disabled.args} />

### Radio Group
<ButtonGroupStories {...stories.RadioButton.args} />

### No Active Button
<ButtonGroupStories {...stories.NoActiveButton.args} />
